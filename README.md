**OpenAV Auto Shutdown Microservice**

This microservice provides endpoints that help shut down devices when they're not in use, but prevents shutdowns during specified hours or when recent activity is detected.

The endpoints allow tracking of device activity, controlling based on time, and detecting occupancy.
